# Scriptorium

Scriptorium tracks my books (reviews, quotes, reading lists). It integrates with Goodreads (as far as still possible),
Calibre and various online APIs. It's currently powering [books.rixx.de](https://books.rixx.de).

## Project status

This project is under heavy development, but stable enough to run [books.rixx.de](https://books.rixx.de). There are
still plenty of actions that require you (me) to use the shell, it's nowhere near an out-of-the-box solution to hosting
your books (and it likely never will be). After setup, adding books via the web interface is possible, though!
